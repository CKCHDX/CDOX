SECURE CHAT FEATURE - IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

Overview:
When the user presses the "Start Chat" button in the C++ application:
1. A local web server starts automatically.
2. A unique, secure chat link is generated.
3. The chat interface appears in the program (embedded tab or window).
4. Friends open the link in their browser to chat securely.
5. All messages are encrypted end-to-end and transmitted over HTTPS.

Components:
-----------
1. C++ Application
   - UI: Button for starting chat, chat tab for messaging.
   - Link Generation:
       * Generate a random, unique URL (e.g., https://<IP-or-domain>/chat/<token>)
       * Token length: 16-32 alphanumeric characters (securely random)
   - Start Embedded Web Server:
       * Libraries: CivetWeb, Boost.Beast, Crow, or Pistache
       * Serve HTML/JS chat page to browser
       * Handle incoming HTTP requests
   - HTTPS Support:
       * Use OpenSSL for TLS
       * Optional: self-signed certificate for local use
       * For public access: Let’s Encrypt + domain

2. Web Chat Interface (HTML + JavaScript)
   - Loads in browser for external users
   - Password/Token Authentication
       * Check link token or user-provided password before enabling chat
   - Chat UI
       * Input box + message area
       * Encrypted messages only (client-side encryption)
   - End-to-End Encryption:
       * Use libsodium.js or Signal Protocol JS
       * Encrypt messages in browser before sending
       * Decrypt messages on C++ client (embedded chat tab)
       * Server acts as a relay only; cannot read messages

3. Message Transmission
   - Protocol: WebSockets or HTTP long-polling
   - Flow:
       * Browser encrypts message → send to server
       * Server forwards encrypted message → C++ chat tab
       * C++ decrypts message using private key
   - Reverse for messages sent from C++ client

4. Security Considerations
   - Use HTTPS at all times
   - Use strong random tokens for links
   - Optionally implement token expiry for one-time chats
   - Properly handle network errors and encryption keys
   - Validate all inputs on server side

Workflow:
--------
1. User presses "Start Chat"
2. C++ app:
   - Generates link and token
   - Starts local web server
   - Opens embedded chat tab for the user
3. User shares the generated link with friend
4. Friend opens link in browser:
   - Browser connects via HTTPS
   - Authenticates with token/password
   - Chat interface appears
5. All messages are encrypted end-to-end:
   - Browser encrypts → sends to server → server relays → C++ client decrypts
   - C++ client encrypts → sends to server → server relays → browser decrypts

Optional Enhancements:
----------------------
- Add chat logging (encrypted locally)
- Support multiple concurrent users (each with unique token)
- Auto-expiry of links after chat ends
- Notification system for incoming messages

Notes:
------
- Avoid storing plaintext messages on server
- Ensure proper handling of encryption keys in C++ app
- Test on both local network and external network (requires port forwarding or ngrok for testing)
- Consider using a lightweight web framework for faster implementation
